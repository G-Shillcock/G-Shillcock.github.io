My research interests include the epidemiology of infectious disease and the interactions that form between species, in particular, the dynamics of pathogens and their hosts. I do that by formulating mathematical models which incorporate the ecology of a population and consider how the individual choices of an organism, such as the virulence of a disease-causing microbe, affect the stability of the relationship it has with its symbiont. This framework allows many generations of interacting hosts and parasites to play out in real time. So that heritable traits that offer advantage are selected for, and coevolution becomes perceptible. A significant component of the analysis is computed using numeric programming languages.

Applying a Mathematical perspective to Biology is important to me because of the responsibility I feel, and I believe we all have, as stewards of the natural world, to better understand and protect biodiversity, to make sustainable choices for the climate, and to foster a resilient ecosystem. I hope that my research, and the understanding it gleams, can influence our perspectives, future scholars work and our policies on conservation.
