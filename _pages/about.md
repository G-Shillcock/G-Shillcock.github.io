I am a mathematician by trade, but interested in biological questions.

Applying a mathematical perspective to biology is important to me because of the responsibility I feel, and I believe we all have, as stewards of the natural world, to better understand and protect biodiversity, to make sustainable choices for the climate, and to foster a resilient ecosystem. I hope that my research, and the understanding it gleams, can influence our perspectives, future scholars work and our policies on conservation.
